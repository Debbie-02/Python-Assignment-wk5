# ðŸš€ OOP Assignment â€“ Polymorphism Challenge

## ðŸ“– Description
This project is part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment. 
It demonstrates **class design, constructors, attributes, methods, inheritance, and polymorphism** using Python.

The program models different **vehicles** (`Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`) that share a common action `move()`, but each class defines it differently.



## ðŸ›  Features
- âœ… **Encapsulation** â€“ Each class has attributes and methods. 
- âœ… **Constructors** â€“ Objects are initialized with unique values. 
- âœ… **Inheritance** â€“ `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` extend a common `Vehicle` class. 
- âœ… **Polymorphism** â€“ The `move()` method behaves differently in each subclass.
